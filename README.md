# Traffic_sign
Traffic sign classification is the process of automatically recognizing traffic signs along the road, including speed limit signs, yield signs, merge signs, etc. Being able to automatically recognize traffic signs enables us to build “smarter cars”.

Self-driving cars need traffic sign recognition in order to properly parse and understand the roadway. Similarly, “driver alert” systems inside cars need to understand the roadway around them to help aid and protect drivers.

Traffic sign recognition is just one of the problems that computer vision and deep learning can solve.
